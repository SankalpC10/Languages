main() function

 

Look at the following piece of code:

int main() {
      Statement 1;
      Statement 2;
      ...
}

 

You can see the highlighted portion above. Letâ€™s discuss each part stepwise.

 

Starting with the line:

 

int main()

 

    int: This is the return type of the function. You will get this thing clear once you reach the Functions topic.
    main(): This is the portion of any C++ code inside which all the commands are written and executed.
        This is the line at which the program will begin executing. This statement is similar to the start block of flowcharts.
        As you will move further in the course, you will get a clear glimpse of this function. Till then, just note that you will have to write all the programs
        inside this block.
    {}: all the code written inside the curly braces is said to be in one block, also known as a particular function scope. Again, these things will be clear when you
    will study functions.

For now, just understand that this is the format in which we are going to write our basic C++ code. As you will move forward with the course, you will get a clear and better
understanding.
