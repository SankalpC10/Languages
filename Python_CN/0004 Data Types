Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. Data types represent a kind of value that determines what operations can be performed on that data.
Numeric, non-numeric, and Boolean (true/false) data are the most used data types. However, each programming language has its classification largely reflecting its 
programming philosophy. Python offers the following built-in data types:

 

● Numbers 

        ○ Integers 

        ○ Floating Point Numbers 

        ○ Complex Numbers

● Strings 

● Boolean Values 

● List, Tuple, and Dictionary

 

 

 

Note:- If a variable has been assigned a value of some data type, It can be reassigned as a value belonging to some other Data Type in the future.

 

a= "Raw" # String Data Type 
a= 10 # Integer Data Type 
a= 5.6 # Floating Point Number Data Type 
a= 1+8j # Complex Number 
a= True # Boolean Value

 
Introduction to Python Numbers

 

Number data types store numerical values. Python supports Integers(defined as int), floating-point numbers(defined as float), and complex numbers(complex classes).

 

● Integers can be of any length (Only limited by the memory available). They do have a decimal point and can be positive or negative.

● A floating-point number is a number having a fractional part. The presence of a decimal point indicates a floating-point number. They have a precision of up to
15 digits.      

● 1 is an integer, 1.0 is a floating-point number.

● Complex numbers have an imaginary part and are of the form, x + yj (where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part).

 

To know which class a variable belongs to we can use the type() function. Similarly, you can use the instance() function to check if an object belongs to a 
particular class.

Here are a few examples:-

 

b = 5 
print(b, "is of type", type(b)) 
b = 2.0 
print(b, "is of type", type(b)) 
b = 1+2j 
print(b, "is complex number?", isinstance(b,complex))

 

And we will get the output as:

 

5 is of type <class ‘int’> 

 

2.0 is of type <class ‘float’> 

 

1+2j is a complex number? True
