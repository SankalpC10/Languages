Python Comments

 

1. Comments can be used to explain Python code.

2. Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

3. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

 
Creating a Comment

 

Comments start with a '#', and Python will ignore them:

 

# This is a how we write a comment in python.
print("Hello, World!")

 
Multi-Line Comments

 

Python does not really have a syntax for multi-line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a '#' for each line:

 

# This way we can
# Write comments in 
# Multiple lines. 
print("Hello, World!")

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

 

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

 

"""
Another way to write
comments in more than one
Line.
"""
print("Hello, World!")

 

Note: We can achieve multi-line comments by using single triple quotes or by double triple quotes.
