In Java, there are mainly two ways to get input from the user:

 

    Using Scanner class
    Using BufferedReader class

 

1. Using Scanner class: Scanner is a class in java that is used to take input from the user. It is present in the java.util package.
Scanner class is one of the most preferable ways to take input from the user. This class is used to read the input of primitive types such as int, double,
long, etc., and some non-primitive(wrapper class objects) types such as String, Boolean, etc. You need to import the java.util package before using the Scanner class.

 

 
Methods of Scanner class in Java:

 

Java Scanner class provides various methods to read different primitive data types from the user.

 
Method	                     Description
nextInt()	             reads an int value from the user.
nextFloat()	           reads a float value from the user.
nextDouble()	         reads a double value from the user.
nextLong()	           reads a long value from the user.
nextShort()	           reads a short value from the user.
nextByte()	           reads a byte value from the user.
nextBoolean()  	       reads a boolean value from the user.
nextLine()	           reads a line of text from the user.
next()	               reads a word from the user.

 

 

Example 1: Taking int value from the user

 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class TakingInputFromUser {

	public static void main(String args[]) {            	
	
		// Creating an object of Scanner class
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// Read integer value from the user
		System.out.println(“Enter first number :”);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println(“Enter second number :”);
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		// Adding two values
		int c = a + b;
		
		// Printing the sum
		System.out.println(“Sum is : “ +c);
		
	}
}

 

Output:

 

Enter first number : 10
Enter second number : 20
Sum is : 30

 

 

Example 2: Taking String from the user

 

import.java.util.Scanner;
public class TakingInputFromUser {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
             Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
             System.out.println(“Enter a String : “);
             // Read a string from the user
             String str = sc.nextLine();
             System.out.println(“Your entered string is : “ + str);
    }
}

 

Output:

 

Enter a String : Coding Ninjas
Your entered string is : Coding Ninjas

 

 

Example 3: Taking char from the user

 

To read a character from the user, we use next().charAt(0). The next() function of the Scanner class returns the next token/words in the input as a String
and charAt(0) function returns the first character in that String.

 

import.java.util.Scanner;
public class TakingInputFromUser {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
             Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
             System.out.println(“Enter a character : “);
             // Read a char from the user
             char ch = sc.next().charAt(0);
             System.out.println(“Your entered character is : “ + ch);
    }
}

 

Output:

 

Enter a character : C
Your entered character is : C

 

 

Example 4: Taking double from the user
 

import.java.util.Scanner;
public class TakingInputFromUser {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
             Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
             System.out.println(“Enter a double value : “);
             // Read a double value from the user
             double d = sc.nextDouble();
             System.out.println(“Your entered value is : “ + d);
    }
}

 

Output:

 

Enter a double value : 10.0
Your entered value is : 10.0

 

If you want to take long, short, and float values from the user, then you can use nextLong(), nextShort(), and nextFloat() methods of Scanner class respectively.

 

 

 

2. Using BufferedReader class: 

 

Java BufferedReader class is used to read the stream of characters from the character input stream. The read() and readLine() method of BufferedReader
class is mainly used to read and return the characters.

 

Example:

 

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader 


public class TakingInputFromUser {
      public static void main(String arg[]) throws IOException {


             // Taking input using BufferedReader
             BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));


             // Reading input using readLine()
             String name = reader.readLine();


             // Printing the input 
             System.out.println(name);
    }
}

 

Input:

 

Coding Ninjas

 

Output:

 

Coding Ninjas
