Features of Java

 

The features of the Java programming language are given below.

    Simple: Java programming language is easy to learn and its syntax is simple and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem,
    the java programming language is simple because the java syntax is similar to C++. So, it is easier for the programmer to learn java after C++.
    Java has removed many rarely-used features like explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc. In java, there is no need to remove unused objects because there
    is an automatic garbage collection in java.
     
    Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in java is an object. We can use the functionality of our program by using objects.
    Object-oriented programming language simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules. The basic concepts of OOPs are classes and objects,
    packages, polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and etc.
     
    Platform independent: Java is a platform-independent programming language. We can write java code once and run it anywhere. Java code can be run on multiple platforms,
    for example, Windows, Linux, Mac, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into byte code. This byte code is platform-independent code because
    it can be run on multiple platforms.
     
    Robust: Java programming language is robust because it uses strong memory management. There is an automatic garbage collection in java to destroy the objects which
    are unused. Exception handling is another feature that makes java programming robust.
     
    Portable: Java programming language is portable because it enables you to carry byte code to any platform.
     
    Multithreaded: Java also supports multithreaded programming. We can create multiple threads in java. The main advantage of multithreading is that it doesnâ€™t occupy
    the memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for web applications, multimedia applications, etc.
     
    Distributed: Java programming language is distributed because it facilitates the user to create distributed applications. We can create distributed applications in java
    by using RMI and EJB.
     
    Secure: When a java program is compiled, it generates a byte code that is in the non-readable form. The java byte code cannot be read by humans.
    That makes the java language secure.

 

 
Uses of Java

 

Java is the most popular, widely used object-oriented programming language. By using java, we can develop a variety of applications such as web applications,
mobile applications, desktop applications, network applications, and many more. Java is used for developing different applications. Some of them are listed below:

    Banking: In banking, the Java programming language is used to develop transaction management.
     
    Mobile App Development: Java can be used to develop mobile applications. Most of the android applications are built using java. So, if you are familiar with java,
    it will become much easier to develop mobile applications.
     
    Desktop Applications: We can also create GUI applications in java. Java provides AWT, Swings, and JavaFX to develop desktop applications.
     
    Big Data: In Big Data, the Hadoop MapReduce framework is written using java.
     
    Web applications: We can also create web applications using java. The most popular frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate used for developing web applications are based on java.
