Before discussing how to take input in java, let’s first understand how to print a statement in java. 

 

 

1. Using println() method: In java, we usually use println() method to print the text on the console. The text is passed as the parameter to this method in
the form of string. This method prints the text on the console, and after printing the text, the cursor remains at the start of the next line at the console. 
The next printing takes place from the next line.

 

Example:

 

System.out.println(“Coding”);
System.out.println(“Ninjas”);

 

Output:

 

Coding
Ninjas

 

 

2. Using print() method: In java, we usually use print() method to print the text on the console. The text is passed as the parameter to this method in the form 
of string. This method prints the text on the console, and after printing the text, the cursor remains at the end of the text at the console. The next printing 
takes place from just here.

Example:

 

System.out.print(“Coding”);
System.out.print(“Ninjas”);

 

 

Output:

 

CodingNinjas

 

 

3. Using printf() method: The printf() method in java is used to print formatted data on the console. The print() and println() method take single arguments,
but printf() method may take multiple arguments.

 

Example:

 

// this will print upto 2 decimal places
System.out.printf(“"Formatted with precision: PI = %.2f\n", Math.PI”);


// Automatically appends Zeros to the 
// rightmost part of the decimal
float f = 5.2f;
System.out.printf(“Formatted to specific width: n = %.4f\n", n”);

 

Output:

 

Formatted with precision: PI = 3.14
Formatted to specific width: n = 5.2000

 

 

 
Example:

 

public class Test {

	public static void main(String args[]) {

		int age = 21;
		String firstName = "King";
		String lastName = "Kong";

		System.out.println("My name is " + firstName + " " + lastName);
		System.out.println("My age is " + age);
	}
	
}

 

Output:

 

My name is King Kong
My age is 21


In the above program, we have declared and initialized three variables: one int variable (age) and two String variables (firstName and lastName). Then, we 
are printing messages along with the values of these variables by using concatenation. We use String concatenation operator + for concatenating strings in java.
