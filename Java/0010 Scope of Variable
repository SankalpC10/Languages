The variable scope is the part of the program where the variable is accessible. The scope of the variable can be determined at compile time.
There are mainly two types of variable scope.

 

1) Local Variables Scope: A variable that is defined inside a block, method body, or constructor is called a local variable. These variables can’t be 
accessed outside the method. 

 

Example:

 

public class VariableScope {
	void method() {
		// local variable (Method Level Scope)
		// This method can’t be accessed outside
		// method body.
		int x;
	}
}

 

 

2) Member/Class Level Variable Scope: A variable that is declared inside the class but outside the method body, block, or constructor is known as member/class 
level variable. These variables can be directly accessed anywhere in the class.

 

Example:

 

class VariableScope {

	// variable defined inside the class
	int x;
}

public class VariableScopeDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
	
		// Creating VariableScope class object
		VariableScope obj = new VariableScope();
		
		// Assigning values in the variable
		obj.x = 10;
		
		// Printing the value
		System.out.println(obj.x);
	}
}

 

Output:

 

10
