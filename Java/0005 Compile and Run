Below are the steps to compile and run your first java program

    Open a text editor like notepad or notepad++.
    Write a java program in your text editor and save it with (.java extension), remember that the file name and the class name must be the same.
    For example, if you are creating a class HelloWorld, then you need to save it with HelloWorld.java.
    Open your command prompt.
    Set the directory where your java program is saved.
    Once you enter the directory where your java program is saved, now it’s time to compile your java program,
    to compile the java program use the command javac HelloWorld.java (In this case my java file is HelloWorld.java).
