Introduction and Declaration of Variables
A Variable is a name given to a memory location. It is used to store a value that may vary. Java is a statically typed language, and hence, 
all the variables are declared before use. 

 

 
Variable Declaration

 

In Java, we can declare variables as follows:

    type: Type of the data that can be stored in this variable. It can be int, float, double, etc.
    name: Name given to the variable.

data_type variable_name;
Example: int x;

 

In this way, we can only create a variable in the memory location. Currently, it doesn’t have any value. We can assign the value in this variable by using two ways:

    By using variable initialization.
    By taking input

Here, we have discussed only the first way, i.e. variable initialization. We will discuss the second way later.

 

data_type variable_name = value;
Example: int x = 10;
