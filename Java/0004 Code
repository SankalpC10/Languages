main() Method
Before explaining the java main() method, let’s first create a simple program to print Hello World. After that, we will explain why the main()
method in java is public static void main(String args[]).

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

    public: the public is an access modifier that can be used to specify who can access this main() method. It simply defines the visibility of the method.
    The JVM calls the main() method outside the class. Therefore it is necessary to make the java main() method as public.
     
    static: static is a keyword in java. We can make static variables and static methods in java with the help of the static keyword. The main advantage of a static method
    is that we can call this method without creating an instance of the class.
    JVM calls the main() method without creating an instance of the class, therefore it is necessary to make the java main() method static.
     
    void: void is a return type of method. The java main() method doesn’t return any value. Therefore, it is necessary to have a void return type.
     
    main: main is the name of the method. It is a method where program execution starts.
     
    String args[]: String in java is a class that is used to work on Strings and args is a reference variable that refers to an array of type String.
    If you want to pass the argument through the command line then it is necessary to make the argument of the main() method as String args[].
