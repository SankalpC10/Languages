Variables naming Convention in Java

    1.A variable name should be short and meaningful.
    2.It should begin with a lowercase letter.
    3.It can begin with special characters such as _ (underscore) and $ (dollar) sign.
   4.If the variable name contains multiple words, then use the camel case, i.e. variable name should start with a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter.
    For eg: codingNinja, camelCase.
    5.Always try to avoid single character variable names such as i, j, and k except for the temporary variables.
    6.A variable name can not contain whitespaces.
    7.We canâ€™t use keywords(pre-defined literals) as the variable names.
